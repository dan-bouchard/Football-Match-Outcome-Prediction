    "# Football Match Predictor - EDA Report\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main Football-Dataset, there are many attributes where exploratory data analysis can be useful to extract some insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the data contains all the results from 1990-2021 inclusive from the top two leagues from the following countries:\n",
    "- England\n",
    "    - Premier League\n",
    "    - Championship\n",
    "- Spain\n",
    "    - Primera Division\n",
    "    - Segunda Division\n",
    "- Germany\n",
    "    - Bundesliga\n",
    "    - 2 Liga\n",
    "- Italy\n",
    "    - Serie A\n",
    "    - Serie B\n",
    "- France\n",
    "    - Ligue 1\n",
    "    - Ligue 2\n",
    "- Netherlands\n",
    "    - Eredivisie\n",
    "    - Eerste Divisie\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between the different leagues\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is some missing data for some years as can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/number_of_teams_each_year_plot.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The leagues affected include the: Championship, Eerste Divisie, Ligue 2 and Serie A. It is unclear whether leagues having a different number of teams will affect the quality of the data and the ability to predict future results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, a direct result of having a different number of teams in each league also means that there are a different number of total matches played in each league every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/number_of_matches_each_year.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some leagues had an incomplete season in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these include: Eredivisie, Eerste Divisie, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. Also, the 2021 season is incomplete as the season is ongoing. The year 2021 refers to the 2021-22 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the data containing only: teams playing, score, year, league and round there is not a huge amount of insights that can be sought. Looking at the average goals per game across the leagues and seasons seems like an obvious place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/number_of_goals_per_game_each_year.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not much trend across different years, so it may be easier to just look at the difference across the different leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/number_of_goals_per_game_in_each_league.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there is not much insight that can be gained from this however, looking at the home and away goals scored per game, it is clear that playing at home is a big advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/number_of_goals_per_game_in_each_league_for_home_and_away.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a home team, is therefore an important attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between the different years\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the split of results across the different years, it can be seen that not much has changed except perhaps the proportion of away wins has steadily increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](/imgs/split_of_results_for_each_year.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there are not too many obvious trends in the dataset other than the home teams tends to score more goals and will probably be more likely to win. More data and further feature engineering is thus essential to aid in future match prediction."
